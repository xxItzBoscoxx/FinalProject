                <div id="descriptionText">
                  <p>Your anxiety can be creating feelings of nervousness or unease. It could be caused by a wide variety of things like the pandemic, the effects of social media, the news, school, family, etc. Whatever the cause, it's best to attempt to calm it before it gets worse and some unwarrented panic sets in.</p>
                  <p>Some ways to reduce anxiety that have proven useful are meditation, gaining control of your breathing, and focusing your thoughts on the issue causing your anxiety. It may seem like a distraction would be better to take your mind off of it, but coming to terms with the issue will help you conquer it.</p>
                  <p>With the issue in mind, try to talk it out with someone you trust or someone willing to help. If you want to tackle it alone, you can list out all the different methods of either avoiding or overcoming the issue causing your anxiety.</p>

                <div id="descriptionText">
                  <p>It takes many different events for depression to build up, making it much more difficult to find the source of the issue without a professional. You may be feeling an overall, constant sadness or a loss of interest in your everyday activities and hobbies.</p>
                  <p>Without being able to pinpoint the issue, you have to take a focus on yourself and building you back up again. Try to get outside and just relax in the sunlight with the fresh air. Turn to someone supportive and just talk.</p>
                  <p>You don't need to constantly talk about your issues, instead, try to engage in and talk about the hobbies that used to make you happy. Find someone who can share those experiences with you to help gradually find normalcy.</p>

                <div id="descriptionText">
                  <p>Although it's commonly known as the term people use on an everyday basis to say they're tired, exhaustion in terms of mental health comes about by excessive burnout mixed with insomnia. An overload of work, too much expression of a sort, or too much social media use can bring this about.</p>
                  <p>There is a strain placed on both the mind and body - the mind, unable to focus, and the body, unwilling to function. You need to make time for both to rest.</p>
                  <p>Listening to soothing music or videos can encourage rest for the body while meditation can provide rest for the mind. Talking to others in similar situations can also allow for a bit of relaxation of both.</p>

                <div id="descriptionText">
                  <p>Due to isolation, feelings of loneliness can skyrocket. Whether it's caused by overuse of social media, quarentine, or just not being able to see those you wish you could, isolation is an important mental health issue plaguing the world today.</p>
                  <p>There are so many different types of isolation and different ways to deal with it. If you feel you need to talk to someone as a friend, but don't know who, try out the discord link. If you're feeling more suffocated, try going out for a walk, sitting outside, or at the very least, opening a window to let some fresh air in.</p>
                  <p>If you're talking to someone over the phone but are really missing the warmth, try wearing a heated blanket while talking to them to simulate the comfort. Although the solutions aren't as great as the real thing, as long as those symptoms are dealed with even a little, you can try your best to push on another day.</p>

Alternatives that require less physical activity is listening to music that calms your mind or trying different inscents with aromatherapy techniques.</p>
                  <p>If there are too many tasks at once causing stress to increase, try making a list of everything you need to do and focus on one at a time. If one is due sooner, put it first and try to eliminate each task one by one to put your mind at ease. Be sure to reward yourself with a break or something that makes you happy in between each task!</p>
